# Why "Open Science"?

- What is this concept of “open” ?
- How & why is it beneficial to the growth of our community
- Examples: 
    - open-source software: SBML, mrgsolve, Shiny etc., STAN/Torsten(?)
    - open model repositories: Biomodels, github, DDmore…
    - Publications, presentations, regulatory docs: 
        - good (model is described with parameter estimates), 
        - better (model mathematics provided with parameter estimates), 
        - best (executable code)
    - PKsim /  MOBI
    - Osmosis Foundation

# How we implement our science 
- Overview of Metworx system: 
    - why share when you don’t have to (Performance), 
    - how to easily share when you want to (Envision)

# About `mrgsolve` 

- `R` package for simulation from ODE-based models
    - Free, OpenSource, GitHub, CRAN
- Language
    - Models written in `C++` inside model specification format
    - General purpose solver: `ODEPACK` / `DLSODA` (`FORTRAN`)
    - Simulation workflow in `R`
- Hierarchical (population) simulation
    - `ID`, $\eta$, $\varepsilon$
- Integrated PK functionaility
    - Bolus, infusion, `F`, `ALAG`, `SS` etc, handled under the hood
    - 1- and 2-cmt PK models in closed-form
- Extensible using `R`, `C++`, `Rcpp`, `boost`, `RcppArmadillo`
- `R` is it's natural habitat

# `mrgsovle` started as `QSP` modeling tool
- Motivation: large bone/mineral homeostatsis model (CaBone)
- History using
    - Berkeley Madonna
    - WinBUGS
    - NONMEM (attempted)
- 2010: write `R` front end to `deSolve`
- 2012: write `C++` interface to `DLSODA`
- Develop dosing / event capability
- More recently, expose functionality provided by
    - `Rcpp` - vectors, matrices, functions, environments, random numbers 
    - `boost` - numerical tools in `C++`
    - users' own `C++` code (functions, data structures, classes)
- Translator from `SBML` to `mrgsolve` using `R` bindings to `libSBML`
